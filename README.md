### Introduction
 
Application Name: ‚ÄúRentEase‚Äù
 
[üîº](#top)

<a name="2"></a>

### Case Study

A client approached you with a request to build an app to help renters to compare their available options. Future renters must make a hard decision which flat, among an available set, they are
going to occupy for a whole year at least. The main request is to develop an app that would allow
future renters to figure out what are the trade off between flats they consider to be relevant so it
will be easier for them to choose.

The app has a single type of user, which is the one who look for a flat. The user is the one who
manage all flats data (insert, update, delete). The app will allow the user to browse all the flats in a user friendly fasion and he will mark and unmark flats as favourites.
